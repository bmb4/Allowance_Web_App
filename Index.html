            <p>
            I am trying to learn web design through various
            sources on the internet I find useful.  In college 
            I spent most of my effort on Operating and Embedded Systems
            but jobs in that sector are limited in my area.
            To increase my skillset and attractiveness to employers
            I am working on this over engineered full stack project
            to demonstrate learning and proficiency with a wide
            range of tools.    
            </p>
